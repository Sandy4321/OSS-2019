Telescope is a set of classes used to easily extract information from the GitHub API.

The Collector class is responsible for handling the requests. The Repository class is responsible
for extracting information from the repositories. The search class is responsible for extracting
information from the search system used on GitHub (We used it to sort projects by languages and stars).

If you felt interested in Telescope, we are developing it in this repository:
